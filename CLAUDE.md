## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Container-Based Deployment**: Everything runs in Docker for maximum portability
2. **Monolithic with Service Boundaries**: Clean module separation for potential microservices extraction
3. **Free-Tier Optimization**: Minimize resource usage, optimize for low traffic
4. **Security First**: JWT auth, OAuth, Stripe for PCI compliance, no card data storage, 2FA for admin
5. **SEO-Focused**: Next.js SSR/SSG, proper meta tags, sitemap generation
6. **Host-Agnostic**: No vendor-specific features, works anywhere Docker runs
7. **Capability-Based RBAC**: Extensible permission framework for future features
8. **Dual Authentication**: Front door (user-facing) and back door (admin) with different security requirements
9. **Persistent Front-Door Logins**: No expiry until logout (user convenience)
10. **Time-Limited Back-Door Logins**: 7-day max + 2FA (admin security)
11. **Markdown Support**: Full for Admin+, limited for Members (security)
12. **External Media Embeds**: YouTube and X posts for Admin/Owner only
13. **Product Taxonomy**: Separate from Articles but parallel, dual-nature design (content + commerce)

## User Management Architecture

**See [PRD 09: User Management & Authentication](./docs/prd/09-user-management-auth.md) for comprehensive details**

### User Roles

1. **Owner** (Super-Admin)
   - All capabilities always enabled
   - Can assign/remove capabilities to/from other roles
   - Only Owners can create other Owners
   - First Owner must be seeded manually
   - Cannot delete themselves (prevent lockout)

2. **Admin**
   - Owner-configurable capabilities
   - Default: Create/edit articles (not pages), products, manage Members, moderate comments
   - Cannot: Manage system settings, payment config, or create Admins/Owners

3. **Member**
   - Standard logged-in user
   - Can: View logged-in content, purchase products, leave comments/reviews, manage own account
   - Cannot: Access admin interfaces or create content

4. **Guest**
   - Unauthenticated session
   - Can: View public content, purchase guest-purchaseable products
   - Cannot: Comment, review, or access logged-in-only content

### Capability System

- **Extensible Framework**: New capabilities can be added in future versions
- **Owner Control**: Owners can assign/remove capabilities from roles via admin UI
- **Capability Categories**: Content Management, Ecommerce, Users, System Configuration
- **Examples**: `article.create`, `product.edit`, `user.delete`, `system.configure`
- **Persists Customizations**: Role customizations preserved across updates

### Authentication Flows

**Front Door** (`/` - Header Login):
- Available to: All roles (Member, Admin, Owner)
- Login methods: Google OAuth, Apple OAuth, Email+Password
- Security: JWT tokens (15 min access, persistent refresh tokens)
- **Session Persistence**: Persistent per device, NO EXPIRY until explicit logout
- No 2FA required (user convenience prioritized)
- "Log Out All Devices" feature to revoke all refresh tokens
- Provides: End-user experience (browse, shop, comment, purchase)
- UI: Login button in header → Modal with all login options

**Back Door** (`/admin`):
- Available to: Admin and Owner only
- Login methods: Email+Password (primary), OAuth (optional)
- Security: JWT tokens (15 min access, 7-day max refresh tokens) + **mandatory 2FA** (TOTP or SMS)
- **Session Expiry**: 7-day rolling expiry or explicit logout
- Automatic logout on 30 minutes of inactivity
- Higher security for administrative access
- Provides: Administrative capabilities (content mgmt, user mgmt, system config)
- UI: Dedicated admin login page with 2FA verification

### Content Visibility

**Articles & Pages**:
- `public`: Visible to everyone (Guests included)
- `logged_in_only`: Visible to Members and above
- `admin_only`: Only visible in admin interface

**Products**:
- Same visibility options as articles
- Additional flag: `guest_purchaseable` (boolean)
  - `true`: Guests can purchase without account
  - `false`: Must be Member to purchase

**Comments & Reviews**:
- Per-article/product setting:
  - `disabled`: No comments allowed
  - `logged_in_only`: Members can comment, only logged-in can view
  - `public`: Members can comment, everyone can view

### 2FA Strategy

**Back Door (Admin/Owner)**:
- **Mandatory** for all back-door logins
- Primary: TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) - FREE, uses authenticator apps
- Backup: SMS (low cost, ~$0.01 per SMS via Twilio/AWS SNS)
- Recovery codes: 10 single-use codes for emergency access
- Works with OAuth: OAuth + 2FA verification for admin access

**Front Door (Members)**:
- Optional (future feature, user-configurable)

**Costs**:
- TOTP: $0 (open-source libraries)
- SMS (optional backup): ~$1-5/month for low-traffic sites
- **No ongoing costs** if using TOTP only

## Development Approach

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript strict mode**: Type safety throughout
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Consistent code formatting
- **Conventional commits**: Semantic commit messages
- **Testing**: 80% backend coverage, 70% frontend coverage
- **Security**: OWASP Top 10 awareness, input validation, sanitization

### Git Workflow
- **Branch strategy**: main, develop, feature/*
- **Pull requests**: Required with code review
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for testing and deployment

### Module Structure (NestJS)
```
src/modules/
├── auth/           # Authentication & authorization
├── users/          # User management
├── content/        # Articles, pages, media, categories, tags
├── commerce/       # Products, cart, orders, payments
└── settings/       # System configuration
```

### Frontend Structure (Next.js)
```

├── (public)/       # Public pages (articles, products, shop)
├── (admin)/        # Admin dashboard
└── api/            # API routes (if needed)
```

## WordPress Migration

**Approach**: Direct database export and transformation
- Export WordPress MySQL database (mysqldump or phpMyAdmin)
- Parse WordPress tables (wp_posts, wp_terms, wp_postmeta)
- Transform to AECMS PostgreSQL schema
- Download media from wp-content/uploads
- Import into AECMS
- Generate URL redirect map for SEO

**Migration Script**: `scripts/migrate-wordpress/`
- Handles posts → articles
- Handles pages → pages
- Transforms categories and tags
- Downloads and re-uploads media
- Transforms shortcodes and WordPress-specific HTML

## Coding Conventions

### General
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Avoid over-engineering (YAGNI principle)
- Write self-documenting code (minimal comments needed)

### Backend (NestJS)
- Use DTOs with class-validator for input validation
- Use Guards for authorization
- Use Interceptors for cross-cutting concerns
- Use Prisma for database operations (no raw SQL unless necessary)
- Return consistent API response format

### Frontend (Next.js)
- Use Server Components by default, Client Components when needed
- Prefer Static Generation (SSG) over Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Use Next.js Image component for all images
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Database
- Use UUIDs for primary keys
- Include created_at and updated_at on all tables
- Use soft deletes where appropriate (deleted_at)
- Index frequently queried columns
- Use JSONB for flexible content fields

### Data Modeling

**Product vs Article Taxonomy**:
- **Products and Articles are SEPARATE entities** (not inheritance)
- Products have **dual nature**: content/display fields + commerce/transaction fields
- Both share common traits: comments, media, visibility, SEO
- MVP: Single Product table with both content and commerce fields
- Future: Can split to `product_content` + `product_commerce` if commerce complexity grows

**Rationale**:
- Clean separation of concerns (content vs commerce)
- Different query patterns and evolution paths
- Avoids nullable fields and schema bloat
- Easier to optimize and scale independently

**Shared Systems**:
- Comments (polymorphic: `article_id` or `product_id`)
- Media (many-to-many via junction tables)
- Visibility controls (same enum: public, logged_in_only, admin_only)
- SEO fields (meta title, description, Open Graph)

### Security
- Never trust client input
- Validate all inputs server-side
- Sanitize HTML content (DOMPurify)
- Use parameterized queries (Prisma handles this)
- Store passwords with bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- Use httpOnly, secure, SameSite cookies
- HTTPS everywhere

### Performance
- Implement caching (Redis) for published content
- Optimize images automatically
- Use CDN for static assets
- Lazy load non-critical components
- Paginate large lists
- Use database connection pooling

3. Add to navigation if needed
4. Implement data fetching (SWR/TanStack Query)
5. Add loading and error states
6. Test responsive design

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Docker containers won't start**:
- Check if ports are already in use: `lsof -i :3000`
- Check Docker daemon is running: `docker ps`
- View container logs: `docker-compose logs [service-name]`

**Database connection fails**:
- Verify DATABASE_URL in .env
- Check PostgreSQL is running: `docker-compose ps`
- Test connection: `psql $DATABASE_URL`

**Prisma migration fails**:
- Check database is accessible
- Review migration files in `prisma/migrations/`
- Reset if needed (development only): `npx prisma migrate reset`

**OAuth not working**:
- Verify client IDs and secrets in .env
- Check redirect URIs match in OAuth provider settings
- Ensure HTTPS in production (OAuth requires secure callback)

**Payment webhooks not receiving**:
- Use ngrok for local testing: `ngrok http 4000`
- Update webhook URL in Stripe/PayPal dashboard
- Verify webhook signature validation

  - Implemented Codespaces URL auto-detection utility
  - Created validation scripts and comprehensive .gitignore
  - Generated detailed completion report
- ✅ Pushed Phase 0 changes to repository (commit: 0ee9f8c)
- ✅ Verified all services running in Docker
- ✅ Started Phase 1: Database Schema & Authentication
  - Defined comprehensive Prisma schema (30+ models, 723 lines)
  - Validated schema with Prisma 7.x
  - Fixed Prisma 7 breaking change (moved URL to prisma.config.ts)

**Key Decisions**:
- **Development Environment**: GitHub Codespaces (cloud-based, web-based workflow)
- **URL Strategy**: Keep localhost in secrets, implement auto-detection for Codespaces
- **Phase 0 Prerequisites**: Already met (Docker, Node.js pre-installed in Codespaces)
- **Phase 1 Approach**: Will restart in dangerously-skip-permissions mode for faster autonomous execution

### Session 3: Phase 1 Continuation (2026-01-29) - NEXT
**Status**: 🔄 Ready to Resume
**Restart Reason**: Switching to dangerously-skip-permissions mode for autonomous Phase 1 completion
**Risk Assessment**: Low risk - Codespaces VM is isolated, all changes reversible via git, no production impact

**Phase 1 Progress**: 10% Complete (1 of 9 tasks)
- ✅ Task #9: Define complete Prisma database schema (DONE)
- ⏳ Task #10: Run Prisma migration and generate client
- ⏳ Task #11: Create configuration module
- ⏳ Task #12: Implement JWT authentication service
- ⏳ Task #13: Create authentication guards and decorators
- ⏳ Task #14: Implement user registration and login endpoints
- ⏳ Task #15: Create database seed script with Owner user
- ⏳ Task #16: Write authentication tests
- ⏳ Task #17: Document Phase 1 completion and create verification guide

**What's Been Built (Phase 1 So Far)**:
- ✅ Complete database schema with 30+ models
  - User Management (6 models): Users, OAuth, RefreshTokens, Capabilities, RBAC
  - Content (12 models): Articles, Pages, Categories, Tags, Media, Versioning
  - Ecommerce (14 models): Products, Digital Products, Cart, Orders, Kindle devices
  - Social (2 models): Comments with AI moderation, Product Reviews
  - System (2 models): Audit Trail (blockchain-like), Settings (encrypted KV store)
- ✅ All relationships, indexes, and constraints defined
- ✅ Granular permissions fields (author_can_edit, admin_can_edit, etc.)
- ✅ Version control for legal documents (EULA, Privacy Policy)
- ✅ AI moderation fields for comments and reviews
- ✅ Guest purchasing support
- ✅ Multi-payment method support (Stripe, PayPal, Amazon Pay)
- ✅ Digital product support (EPUB, PDF with personalization)

**Next Actions (Session 3)**:
1. Run Prisma migration to create database tables
2. Generate Prisma Client
3. Create NestJS configuration module with environment validation
4. Implement JWT authentication service (token generation, refresh, password hashing)
5. Create authentication guards and decorators
6. Implement auth endpoints (register, login, refresh, logout)
7. Create database seed with first Owner user
8. Write comprehensive authentication tests
9. Document Phase 1 completion
10. Commit and push all changes

**Estimated Time for Remaining Phase 1**: 1-2 hours (autonomous with dangerously-skip-permissions)

## GitHub Codespaces Configuration Notes

### Environment Variables Strategy

**Current Setup (Phase 0-1)**:
All secrets configured in GitHub Codespaces Secrets at:
`https://github.com/WCCollier/AECMS/settings/secrets/codespaces`

**Required Secrets (Configured)**:
```
DB_PASSWORD         = [generated with openssl rand -base64 32]
JWT_SECRET          = [generated with openssl rand -base64 32]
JWT_EXPIRATION      = 15m
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION = 7d
NODE_ENV            = development
APP_URL             = http://localhost:3000
API_URL             = http://localhost:4000
FRONTEND_URL        = http://localhost:3000
FRONTEND_ADMIN_URL  = http://localhost:3000/admin
REDIS_URL           = redis://redis:6379
```

**Placeholder Secrets (For Future Phases)**:
- OAuth: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, APPLE_CLIENT_ID, APPLE_CLIENT_SECRET
- Payments: STRIPE_*, PAYPAL_*, AMAZON_PAY_*
- AI: OPENAI_API_KEY
- Email: AWS_SES_*

### URL Handling in Codespaces

**Challenge**: Codespaces generates dynamic URLs like:
- Frontend: `https://[codespace-name]-3000.app.github.dev`
- Backend: `https://[codespace-name]-4000.app.github.dev`

**Solution**: Auto-detection pattern implemented in Phase 0:
```typescript
// backend/src/config/environment.ts
export function getPublicUrl(defaultUrl: string, port: number): string {
  if (process.env.CODESPACES === 'true') {
    const codespace = process.env.CODESPACE_NAME;
    const domain = process.env.GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN;
    return `https://${codespace}-${port}.${domain}`;
  }
  return defaultUrl;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Works in any codespace (handles dynamic names)
- Falls back to localhost for local development
- No secret updates needed between environments
- Ready for OAuth callbacks in Phase 1

### Codespaces-Specific Environment Variables (Auto-provided)

GitHub Codespaces automatically provides:
```bash
CODESPACES=true
CODESPACE_NAME=[unique-name-hash]
GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN=app.github.dev
```

These are used for auto-detection and URL construction.

## Resume Instructions for New Claude Instance

### Quick Start (If Resuming After Environment Migration)

1. **Verify Codespaces Secrets Still Loaded**:
   ```bash
   env | grep -E '(DB_PASSWORD|JWT_SECRET|NODE_ENV)' | cut -d= -f1 | sort
   ```
   Expected: 10+ environment variables listed

2. **Check Project Status**:
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/AECMS
   ls -la
   # Look for: backend/, frontend/, docker-compose.yml
   ```

3. **Determine Current Phase**:
   - If `backend/` and `frontend/` exist → Phase 0 complete, check Phase 1 status
   - If only `docs/` exists → Phase 0 needs to run
   - Check `docker-compose ps` to see if services are running

4. **Review Recent Git Commits**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -10
   ```
   This shows what's been completed

5. **Read Session History** (above) to understand decisions made

6. **Ask Claude**: "What phase are we on and what's the next step?"

### Critical Context for New Claude Instance

- **Development Environment**: GitHub Codespaces (NOT local development)
- **All Secrets**: Configured in GitHub Codespaces Secrets (NOT .env files)
- **URL Strategy**: Auto-detection implemented (keeps localhost in secrets)
- **Docker**: Pre-installed in Codespaces (no Docker Desktop needed)
- **Implementation Plan**: Located at `/workspaces/AECMS/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- **PRD Documentation**: Located at `/workspaces/AECMS/docs/prd/` (12 documents)

### If Services Are Running

```bash
# Check running containers
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Access services (Codespaces will show forwarded URLs in Ports tab)
# Or use: gh codespace ports
```

### If Starting Fresh After Migration

1. All GitHub Codespaces Secrets persist (no need to reconfigure)
2. Clone repo in new codespace (secrets auto-inject)
3. Continue from wherever git history shows you left off
4. Claude can run validation scripts to verify phase completion
